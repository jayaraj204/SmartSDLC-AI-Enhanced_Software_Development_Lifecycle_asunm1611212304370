# SmartSDLC – AI-Powered Software Development Lifecycle Assistant  

## 📌 Overview  
**SmartSDLC** is an AI-enhanced platform designed to streamline the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**.  
It helps developers, testers, and project managers by **classifying requirements**, **generating code snippets**, and **fixing buggy code** through an interactive chat-style interface.  

This project demonstrates how AI can automate key parts of software development, making the process **smarter, faster, and more reliable**.

## ✨ Features  
- **Requirement Classification** 📝  
  - Automatically classifies user stories or requirements into SDLC phases:  
    - Requirements  
    - Design  
    - Development  
    - Testing  
    - Deployment  

- **AI Code Generator** 💻  
  - Generates working code from natural language prompts.  
  - Supports multiple prompts at once (e.g., *“Create factorial”*, *“Reverse string”*).  

- **Bug Fixer** 🔧  
  - Detects and fixes common code issues such as logic errors or missing syntax.  
  - Displays corrected code in a clean, formatted block.  

- **User-Friendly Interface** 🎨  
  - Chat-style input/output.  
  - Requirement phases shown in **cards**.  
  - Code displayed in **syntax-highlighted blocks**.
